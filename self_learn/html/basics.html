        <span class="upper">koala</span> or, inaccurately, koala bear[a] (Phascolarctos cinereus), is
        an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only
        extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest
        living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family
        Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's
        eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales,
        Victoria, and South Australia.

        It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head
        with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a
        body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur
        colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the
        northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than
        their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are
        separate subspecies, but this is disputed.
